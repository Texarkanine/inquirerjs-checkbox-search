# Checkbox Search - Rendering Issue Troubleshooting

## Problem Statement
UI is not updating when tab key is pressed to make selections. Need systematic diagnosis to identify and fix the root cause.

## Troubleshooting Progress

### 1. Progress Tracking ✅
- ✅ Created troubleshooting task list

### 2. Step Back & Re-Scope
- [ ] Identify core functionality involved: multi-select rendering system
- [ ] Focus on: tab selection → state update → UI re-render flow

### 3. Map Relevant System Structure
- [ ] Examine current implementation structure
- [ ] Map state flow: keypress → state update → rendering
- [ ] Identify all components in the render chain

### 4. Hypothesize Potential Root Causes
- [ ] State update not occurring correctly
- [ ] UI render not triggered by state changes
- [ ] Pagination system not reflecting state changes
- [ ] Event handling not working correctly
- [ ] Data flow timing/closure issues

### 5. Systematic Investigation & Evidence Gathering
- [x] Check current test status: 15/33 tests passing
- [x] **CONFIRMED ISSUE**: Tab keypress not changing ◯ to ◉ 
  - Test: "should toggle selection with tab key"
  - Expected: ◉ (checked symbol)
  - Actual: ◯ (unchecked symbol) 
  - Tab key detected, but UI not updating
- [ ] Examine state flow: keypress → allItems update → filteredItems update → pagination render
- [ ] Verify actual state changes vs UI render
- [ ] Check usePagination key dependency system

### 6. Identify Confirmed Root Cause ✅
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: usePagination not reactively updating with state changes
  - Tab detection: ✅ Working
  - State updates: ✅ Working (allItems & filteredItems update correctly)
  - **ISSUE**: renderItem receives stale data despite filteredItems having updated state
  - **SPECIFIC**: filteredItems shows Apple checked: true, but renderItem gets Apple checked: false
  - **CONCLUSION**: usePagination hook needs to be forced to recreate when filteredItems data changes

### 7. Propose Targeted Solution ✅
- [x] **SOLUTION**: Make renderItem function reactive using useMemo
  - Problem: usePagination renderItem was using stale data from filteredItems
  - Fix: renderItem now looks up current state from allItems (source of truth)
  - Implementation: useMemo with [allItems, theme] dependencies

### 8. Plan Comprehensive Verification ✅
- [x] Test the specific failing test: "should toggle selection with tab key"
- [x] Run full test suite to check for regressions
- [x] Verify debug output shows correct state flow

### 9. Execute & Verify ✅
- [x] **SUCCESS**: Tab selection test now passes!
- [x] Debug output confirms: renderItem now receives currentChecked: true
- [x] Both select and deselect operations working correctly

### 10. Report Outcome ✅
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE**: usePagination renderItem function was using stale data
- [x] **FIX**: Made renderItem reactive by looking up current state from allItems
- [x] **RESULT**: Tab selection now works correctly - UI updates when state changes
- [x] **VERIFICATION**: Test "should toggle selection with tab key" now passes

## Investigation Notes
- Previous symptoms: Tab detection working, state updating, but UI showing stale data
- Core issue appears to be in render pipeline, not event handling
