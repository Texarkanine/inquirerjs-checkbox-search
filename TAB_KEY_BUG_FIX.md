# Tab Key Bug Fix Implementation

Critical bug fix: Tab key is incorrectly adding tab characters to the search text instead of only selecting/toggling items.

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Root Cause:** Node.js readline was preprocessing tab characters and converting them to spaces before our keypress handler could intercept them, causing tab characters to pollute the search text.

**Solution:** Implemented search term preservation in the tab key handler that saves the current search term before processing the tab keypress and forcibly restores it after selection toggle, preventing any readline interference.

**Tests Added:**
1. "should not add tab characters to search text when toggling selections"
2. "should detect readline tab-to-spaces conversion bug"  
3. Fixed "should toggle selection with tab key, not perform autocomplete" (corrected from wrong autocomplete behavior)

**Verification:** All tab-related functionality now works correctly - tab only toggles selection and never affects search text.

## Implementation Plan

The tab key should only be used for:
1. Selecting/toggling the currently highlighted choice
2. Never adding tab characters to the search text
3. Not performing any autocomplete functionality

### Issues Identified

1. Tab characters are being added to search text when filtering
2. Existing test "should autocomplete with tab key" suggests incorrect behavior
3. Missing regression test for the core tab key behavior
