## Release Process

Releases are automated using [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please):

1. When PRs are merged to `main`, release-please analyzes commit messages
2. It creates/updates a release PR with version bumps and changelog
3. When the release PR is merged, it:
   - Creates a GitHub release
   - Publishes to npm automatically
   - Updates version tags

Version bumping follows semantic versioning:
- `fix:` commits trigger patch releases (1.0.1)
- `feat:` commits trigger minor releases (1.1.0) 
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` trigger major releases (2.0.0)
