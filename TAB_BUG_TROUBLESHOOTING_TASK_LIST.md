# Tab Bug Troubleshooting - Task List

## Problem Statement

After the phantom input bug fix, a residual issue remains:

- **Residual tab bug**: After tab selections, exactly ONE backspace is required before search input works correctly
- User has updated test case to properly catch this failure-to-backspace behavior

## Systematic Re-Diagnosis Plan

### 1. Progress Tracking ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS

- ‚úÖ Created troubleshooting task list
- ‚úÖ User fixed test assertion (`"mel"` ‚Üí `mel`) - test now passes
- ‚è≥ **CURRENT**: Critical insight - test passes but live behavior still has bug!

### 2. Step Back & Re-Scope ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- ‚úÖ **PRECISE BUG CONFIRMED**: After tab selections, first backspace keystroke is lost/ignored
- ‚úÖ Search functionality is working - issue is phantom character requiring one backspace to "wake up"
- ‚úÖ User provided excellent live trace showing exact behavior
- ‚úÖ **APPLIED FIX**: Implemented `rl.cursor = newTerm.length` in updateSearchTerm()

### 3. Map Relevant System Structure ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- ‚úÖ Read current implementation in src/index.ts - tab handling with preservedSearchTerm
- ‚úÖ Analyzed test case that now passes - uses `events.type('mel')`
- ‚úÖ Added .tshy-build to .gitignore, .prettierignore (eslint already had it)
- ‚è≥ **CURRENT**: Need to understand test vs. real readline behavior difference

### 4. Hypothesize Potential Root Causes ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE**: Incorrect readline manipulation with `rl.line` direct assignment
- ‚úÖ **NEW CRITICAL INSIGHT**: "Esc" stacks up invisible chars, "tab" doesn't - suggesting different handling paths
- ‚úÖ **SOLUTION**: Use official pattern `rl.clearLine(0) + rl.write()` instead of `rl.line` assignment
- ‚úÖ **APPLIED**: Updated updateSearchTerm() to use proper readline API

### 5. Systematic Investigation & Evidence Gathering ‚è≥ PENDING

- ‚è≥ Analyze failing test output and expected behavior
- ‚è≥ Trace the exact sequence: tab selection ‚Üí search input ‚Üí backspace requirement
- ‚è≥ Check readline state immediately after tab vs. after first backspace
- ‚è≥ Add diagnostic logging if needed to see internal state changes

### 6. Identify Confirmed Root Cause ‚è≥ PENDING

- ‚è≥ Pinpoint the specific mechanism causing the one-backspace requirement

### 7. Propose Targeted Solution ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**: Added `rl.cursor = newTerm.length` to `updateSearchTerm()`
- ‚úÖ This ensures readline cursor position matches the line content after tab operations
- ‚úÖ Should eliminate the one-backspace requirement without regressing phantom input fixes

### 8. Plan Comprehensive Verification ‚è≥ PENDING

- ‚è≥ Test the specific failing scenario
- ‚è≥ Verify all phantom input tests still pass
- ‚è≥ Run full test suite

### 9. Execute & Verify ‚è≥ PENDING

- ‚è≥ Implement the targeted fix
- ‚è≥ Execute comprehensive verification plan

### 10. Report Outcome ‚è≥ PENDING

- ‚è≥ Document root cause, fix, and verification results

## Status: üîç **ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING**
