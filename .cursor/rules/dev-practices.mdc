# Core Techniques for Working with inquirerjs-checkbox-search

## Runing Tests

**ONLY** use the following methods to run tests:

1. whole test suite: `npm test`
2. specific test or group: `npx vitest run -t "TEST_NAME"`
    * example: `npx vitest run -t "should maintain selections across filtering"`

The `--reporter=verbose` option doesn't do anything; don't use it with tests.

## Code Quality

**ONLY** use the following methods to run code quality checks:

1. lint: `npm run lint:check` to see problems, or `npm run lint` to potentially fix problems too
2. formatting: `npm run format:check` to see problems, or `npm run format` to potentially fix problems too
