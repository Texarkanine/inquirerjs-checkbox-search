# Core Techniques for Working with inquirerjs-checkbox-search

## Runing Tests

**ONLY** use the following methods to run tests:

1. whole test suite: `npm test`
2. specific test or group: `npx vitest run -t "TEST_NAME"`
    exampe: `npx vitest run -t "should maintain selections across filtering"`

The `--reporter=verbose` doesn't do anything; don't use it.
