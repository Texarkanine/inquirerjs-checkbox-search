# LEVEL 3 IMPLEMENTATION: BUILDING INTERMEDIATE FEATURES

> **TL;DR:** This guide focuses on the systematic implementation of a planned and designed Level 3 feature using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. It emphasizes writing tests FIRST, then implementing modules to pass those tests, strict adherence to creative decisions and the style guide, integration with existing systems, and thorough feature-specific testing.

## 🛠️ Level 3 Feature Implementation Workflow

This workflow outlines the typical steps for building an intermediate feature.

## 🔑 Key Considerations for Level 3 Implementation

  * **Modularity & Encapsulation:** Design and build the feature in well-defined, reusable, and loosely coupled modules or components.
  * **Adherence to Design:** Strictly follow the decisions documented in `memory-bank/creative-*.md` files and the `memory-bank/style-guide.md`. Deviations must be justified and documented.
  * **State Management:** If the feature introduces or significantly interacts with complex application state, ensure the state management strategy (potentially defined in CREATIVE mode) is correctly implemented and tested.
  * **API Interactions:**
      * If consuming new or existing APIs, ensure requests and responses are handled correctly, including error states.
      * If exposing new API endpoints as part of the feature, ensure they are robust, secure, and documented.
  * **Error Handling:** Implement user-friendly error messages and robust error handling within the feature's scope.
  * **Performance:** Be mindful of performance implications. Avoid common pitfalls like N+1 database queries, inefficient algorithms, or large asset loading without optimization, especially if identified as a concern in the PLAN or CREATIVE phase.
  * **Security:** Implement with security best practices in mind, particularly for features handling user input, authentication, or sensitive data. Refer to any security design decisions from CREATIVE mode.

## 🧪 Testing Focus for Level 3 Features (TDD)

**CRITICAL: Tests are written BEFORE implementation (TDD)**

  * **Unit Tests (TDD):** For each new function, method, or logical unit, write the unit tests FIRST, then implement the code to pass those tests. Tests should initially fail. Aim for good coverage of core logic and edge cases.
  * **Component Tests (for UI features - TDD):** Write tests for UI components FIRST, then implement the components. Test rendering, props handling, and event emissions.
  * **Integration Tests (TDD):** Crucial for L3. Write integration tests FIRST for how modules/components will work together, then implement to pass those tests. Also test how the feature integrates with existing parts of the application.
  * **User Scenario / Acceptance Tests (Feature-Specific):** Validate that the feature fulfills its defined requirements and user stories from the user's perspective. This can be manual or automated.

## 📝 Documentation During Implementation

  * **`memory-bank/tasks.md`:** Update the status of sub-tasks related to the feature as they are completed. Note any blockers or changes in estimates.
  * **`memory-bank/progress.md`:** Make regular entries detailing:
      * Modules/components completed.
      * Key decisions made during implementation (if minor and not warranting a full CREATIVE cycle).
      * Files significantly modified
      * Test results for major integration points.
      * Any deviations from the plan or creative designs, with rationale.
  * **Code Comments:** Write clear, concise comments explaining complex logic, assumptions, or TODOs.
  * **READMEs (if applicable):** If the feature introduces new modules or libraries that require specific setup or usage notes, consider adding or updating relevant README files.
