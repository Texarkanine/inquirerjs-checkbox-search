# Test Fix: Async Source Loading Issues

## Problem Statement
Tests: "should handle async source function", "should show loading state during async operations", "should handle async source errors gracefully", "should cancel previous requests when search changes"
**Issue**: All async tests stuck showing "Loading choices..." and never completing

## Expected vs Actual
- **Expected**: Items load after async delay and show properly
- **Actual**: Perpetual "Loading..." state, items never appear

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Debug Async Loading Logic ✅  
- ✅ Tests use 10-100ms delays but may have timing issues
- ✅ Reduced debounce from 200ms to 50ms but still failing
- ✅ **IDENTIFIED ISSUE**: All async tests show perpetual "Loading choices..." - async completion not working
- [ ] Check if loadChoices async function completes successfully
- [ ] Verify setStatus('idle') gets called after await
- [ ] Debug if the issue is in the useEffect async logic flow

### 2. Debug State Updates
- [ ] Check if normalized choices are properly set in allItems
- [ ] Verify useEffect async logic flow
- [ ] Test if setAllItems updates trigger re-render
- [ ] Debug status state transitions

### 3. Fix Implementation
- [ ] Ensure async source function completes successfully
- [ ] Fix status management (loading → idle)
- [ ] Verify proper error handling and abort logic
- [ ] Fix timing issues with test expectations

### 4. Verify Fix
- [ ] All async tests pass with proper loading → results flow
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Request cancellation works properly
