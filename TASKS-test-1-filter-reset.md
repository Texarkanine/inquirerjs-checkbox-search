# Test Fix: Filter Reset Bug

## Problem Statement
Test: "should reset filter when search term is cleared"
**Issue**: After typing "apple" and clearing with backspace, "Cherry" is missing from results

## Expected vs Actual
- **Expected**: Apple, Banana, Cherry (all items visible after clearing filter)
- **Actual**: Apple, Banana (Cherry is missing)

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Identify Root Cause ✅
- ✅ Test sequence: initial → type "apple" → clear with 5 backspaces → expect all items
- ✅ Filter function should return all items when search term is empty/cleared
- ✅ **SPECIFIC ISSUE**: After clearing "apple" filter, only "Apple" and "Banana" appear, "Cherry" is missing
- [ ] **INVESTIGATION**: Check if Cherry is somehow lost during the filtering rebuilding process
- [ ] Verify filter clearing triggers proper re-render
- [ ] Check if rl.line properly reflects cleared state after backspaces

### 2. Debug Filter Logic
- [ ] Test defaultFilter function with empty string input
- [ ] Verify useEffect dependency array for filtering
- [ ] Check searchTerm state updates during backspace sequence
- [ ] Verify filteredItems state after clearing

### 3. Fix Implementation
- [ ] Ensure backspace keypress properly updates searchTerm
- [ ] Fix any timing issues with state updates
- [ ] Verify filter clearing doesn't corrupt allItems

### 4. Verify Fix
- [ ] Test passes: all items appear after clearing filter
- [ ] No regressions in other filtering tests
